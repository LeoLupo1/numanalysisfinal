## Overview

Multidimensional root-finding methods are essential tools in numerical analysis, enabling the solution of nonlinear systems of equations represented as:

$$
F(X) = \mathbf{0},
$$

where $F$ is a vector-valued function, and $X$ is an $n$-dimensional vector of variables. These methods are vital in applications ranging from engineering and optimization to physics and machine learning, where nonlinear behaviors often arise. [1](#ref1)

Unlike one-dimensional root-finding methods, which solve $f(x) = 0$, multidimensional methods require solving a system of equations simultaneously. This introduces significant challenges, such as the need to compute or approximate the Jacobian matrix, sensitivity to initial guesses, and higher computational cost.

This paper explores the key methods used in multidimensional root finding, their practical implementations, and the unique challenges they pose. Additionally, it highlights real-world applications and potential areas for future research.


## Example

### Problem setup

Consider a chemical reaction system with two species, $A$ and $B$, governed by the following nonlinear equations:

$$
R_1(C_A, C_B) = 2C_A^2 - 3C_B = 0,
$$

$$
R_2(C_A, C_B) = C_B^2 - 4C_A = 0,
$$

where $C_A$ and $C_B$ are the concentrations of species $A$ and $B$, respectively.
### Goal

The goal is to find the equilibrium concentrations $(C_A, C_B)$ where both reaction rates are zero. This requires solving the system of equations:

1. $2C_A^2 - 3C_B = 0$
2. $C_B^2 - 4C_A = 0$

### Why multidimensional methods are needed

- The equations are nonlinear, meaning they cannot be solved algebraically without significant simplifications.
- The variables $C_A$ and $C_B$ are interdependent, requiring simultaneous solutions.
